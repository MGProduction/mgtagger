# language packs

In this folder there are several ready-to-use .mg files (plain text dictionary files - you can give them a look if you want) 
I have generated from UD Treebanks (http://universaldependencies.org/).

Anyway, it's possible to generate a language .mg file from any corpus (even form ones less rich than those in .conllu format), so these files are just here to make your life easier if you
want to check the quality/speed/whatever of this little C tool.
