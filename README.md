# mgtagger
This is a very simple generic pos tagger, featuring ngrams with most common word spice, with Viterbi-like code.

It's able to work with inline pos tagged file (the/DT cat/NN is/VBZ on/IN the/DT table/NN) or with conllu files
(in which case you can select which feature set to use, and you'll also get base forms in output.
It generates (and it's able to load) a (text) .mg file - lex + ngrams - so you can easily use different ones.
It works in utf8 - but you can switch it to codepage (changing this setting in the code)

To use it you in your code you simply need mgtagger_postag.c + mgtagger_private.h / mgtagger.h
